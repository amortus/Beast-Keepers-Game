**Production URL:** https://vanilla-game-crfjkt6el-amortus-projects.vercel.app

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed in v1.0.1

### **1. Modal Choice System - MAJOR FIX**

**Problem:** All choice modals were broken after v1.0.0 release
- Vila NPC selection didn't work
- Tournament rank selection failed
- Any modal with multiple choices crashed

**Root Cause:** `modal-ui.ts` was passing choice **text** to callbacks, but `main.ts` was still trying to `parseInt()` the values as if they were indices.

**Solution:** 
- Changed Vila modal to use `npcChoices.indexOf(choice)`
- Changed Tournament modal to use `rankNames.indexOf(choice)`
- Consistent text-based approach across all modals

### **2. Missing Back Buttons**

**Problem:** Players couldn't cancel out of choice modals (Vila, Tournament)

**Solution:** Added centered "← Voltar" button to all choice modals below the options.

### **3. CORS Issues**

**Problem:** Vercel creates new URL for each deployment, causing CORS errors

**Solution:** Backend now accepts all `*.vercel.app` domains

### **4. Railway Deployment**

**Problem:** Initial attempts to use Vercel for both frontend and backend failed

**Solution:** Split deployment - Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
